<h3>The Cast</h3>
<h4>From left to right</h4>
<h4><b>Private Pike</b> ( 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Lavender>Ian Lavender</a> ) the youngest of the platoon, a cosseted mother's boy, constantly wearing a thick scarf with his uniform to prevent illness and often the target of Mainwaring's derision ("You stupid boy!"). He works for Mainwaring in his day job as an assistant bank clerk.</h4>
  <h4><b>Private Frazer</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Laurie>John Laurie</a> ) a dour Scottish undertaker and a former Chief Petty Officer on HMS Defiant in the Royal Navy. He served at the Battle of Jutland as a ship's cook and also has a medal for having served on Shackleton's Antarctic expedition.</h4>
  <h4><b>Mr Yeatman</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Sinclairr>Edward Sinclair</a> ) the verger at St Aldhelm's Church and Scoutmaster of the local Sea Scout troop. He is often hostile to the platoon while frequently sycophantic to the vicar, who often struggles to tolerate him.</h4>
  <h4><b>ARP Warden Hodges</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pertwee>Bill Pertwee</a> ) the platoon's major rival and nemesis. Mainwaring looks down on him as a greengrocer. As an ARP Warden, he is always demanding that people "put that light out"</h4>
  <h4><b> The Reverend Timothy Farthing</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Williams_(actor)>Frank Williams</a> ) the effete, huffy vicar of St. Aldhelm's Church. He reluctantly shares his church hall and office with Mainwaring's platoon.</h4>
  <h4><b>Captain Mainwaring </b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Lowe>Arthur Lowe</a> ) the pompous, if essentially brave and unerringly patriotic local bank manager, Mainwaring appointed himself leader of his town's contingent of Local Defence Volunteers. He had been a lieutenant in the First World War, but is embarrassed by the fact that he never saw combat, being sent to France after the Armistice and then part of the Army of Occupation in Germany.</h4>
<h4><b>Private Godfrey</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Ridley>Arnold Ridley</a> ) a retired shop assistant, who had worked at the Army & Navy Store in London. He lives in Walmington with his elderly sisters and serves as the platoon's medical orderly. He often gets "caught short" and needs to "be excused". A conscientious objector during the First World War, he was nevertheless awarded the Military Medal for heroic actions as a combat medic. He also demonstrated bravery during his Home Guard service particularly during an episode where Mainwaring, seemingly unconscious in a smoke filled room, is rescued by Godfrey.</h4>
<h4><b>Sergeant Wilson</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Le_Mesurier>John Le Mesurier</a> ) a diffident, upper-class bank employee who would quietly question Mainwaring's judgement ("Do you think that's wise, Sir?"). Wilson actually had served as a Captain in the First World War, but he does not admit that until the end of the series. He lodges with the Pike family and is implied to be in a relationship with the widowed Mrs Pike (and sometimes hinted to be Private Pike's biological father) although this is never explicitly stated</h4>
  <h4><b>Corporal Jones</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Dunn>Clive Dunn</a> ) the local butcher, born in 1870. Jones was an old campaigner who had enlisted as a drummer boy at age 14 and participated, as a boy soldier, in the Gordon Relief Expedition of 1884–85 and, as a man soldier, in Kitchener's campaign in the Sudan in 1896–98. Dunn was considerably younger than he appeared, being only in his 40s at the start of filming and this allowed him to take part in some of the more physical comedy of the show.</h4>
<h4><b>Private Walker</b> ( <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Beck>James Beck</a> ) a black market Cockney spiv, Walker was the only fit, able-bodied man of military age in Walmington-on-Sea's Home Guard. He was discharged from the regular armed forces because of an allergy to corned beef.</h4>
